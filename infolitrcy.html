         <p>In-Library Orientations are typically tailored to class needs and cover research tools specific to the subject being taught.  For example, an engineering class orientation would cover such electronic resources as the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, ASCE (CE) and would focus on reference sources and periodicals that are of particular usefulness to engineering majors.
